## General Information
* ### Project Description: In this project me and a colaborator will design and implement reliable and functional custom flight-controller software that will run on an Arduino Nano V3 33 iot. Said iteration of the Arduino Nano microcontroller ships loaded with IMU and bluetooth hardware. An android app developed on Qt creator will serve as the primary avenue of communication with the Quadcopter: i.e., the app will function as the transmitter or controller for the Quadcopter. 
* ### Primary Features to Implement:
- #### Self Stabilize flight mode - Default flight mode that keeps the quadcopter level and orientated during flight via the usage of the Arduino's gyroscope and accelerometer. 
- #### Acro/Sport mode - little to no self stabilizing, the operator has full control of quadcopter and is responsible for keeping the quadcopter orientated.
